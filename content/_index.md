| Field Name | FieldName | String<br/>  [Descriptor] | The field name is what you an your users see throughout the interface.  |  
| Field API Name | FieldApiName | String<br/>  [Required]<br/>  [Descriptor]<br/>  [Unique]<br/>  [MinLen: 2]<br/>  [MaxLen: 50]<br/>  [Regex: ^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*$]<br/>  [ReadOnlyAfterInsert] | A unique and url-safe API name for this field. It is used to refer to the field in processes and in the external API. For custom fields, the name is derived from the field name and can only be edited when creating a new custom field.  |  
| SQL Field Name | SqlFieldName | String<br/>  [ReadOnly] | The actual field name in the underylying SQL Database. This is the same as the FieldName for standard fields. Custom fields are stored in SQL tables with the name FlexField. |  
| Short Field Name | ShortFieldName | String |  |  
| Entity Id | EntityId | Guid<br/>  [ForeignKey MetaEntity]<br/>  [Required] |  |  
| Entity Name | EntityName | String<br/>  [ReadOnlyAfterInsert] |  |  
| Data Type | DataType | FieldDataType<br/>  [Required]<br/>  [ReadOnlyAfterInsert] | <br/>  Allowable Values: <br/>  <br/>  **Unknown**<br/>  **Text**: Used to enter any combination of letters, numbers and symbols that will fit on a single line.  <br/>  **TextArea**: Use to enter text on separate lines. The default height is 4 lines, but you can set Display Lines to a height of between 1 and 50 lines. <br/>  **MarkdownTextArea**: Markdown text area fields can be edited with a lightweight markup language used to add formatting to text. It allows you to easily add bold, italics, hyperlinks, lists, paragraphs, headers, code blocks and images to texts. <br/>  **Number**: Use to enter numbers that may require decimals, such as to track distance travelled. Use Display Decimals to set the number of decimal places to display to the right of the decimal separator. The default display and editing format is limited to 2 digits to the right of the decimal separator, although 4 decimal places are stored. <br/>  **Currency**: Use for currency values. The default display and editing format is limited to 2 digits to the right of the decimal separator, although 4 decimal places are stored. Specific values such as Currency Exchange rates are stored with 9 decimal places. <br/>  **Integer**: Use to enter whole numbers without decimals, for example, an item count or a person's age. <br/>  **Percent**: Allows users to enter a percentage as number and display it in a percentage box. Internally percentages are stored in decimal form, for example, entering 10.5 will be stored as 0.105 which is useful when exporting to Excel. <br/>  **Date**: Allows users to enter a date or pick a date from a popup calendar. <br/>  **DateTime**: Allows users to enter a date or pick a date from a popup calendar and enter a time of day. <br/>  **Checkbox**: Allows users to check a box, indicating true or false. <br/>  **ValueList**: Users can select a value from a list of options specific to this field. <br/>  **Picklist**: Lets users select a value from a central picklist that you define. Checking the MultiSelect option will allow users to select more than one value from the list and display the selected items as tags on forms and pages. <br/>  **Lookup**: Creates a relationship between two records so you can associate them with each other. For example, opportunities have a lookup relationship with contacts that lets you associate a particular contact with an opportunity. Lookup fields are displayed as a searchable dropdown list containing the name field for that entity, e.g. the ContactName for Contacts. <br/>  **HeaderDetail**: Creates a relationship between this record and multiple child records ###<br/>  **Email**: Allows users to enter an email address which is validated to ensure it is a properly formatted e-mail address.<br/>  **Password**<br/>  **Image**: Allows users to upload an image such a picture of themselves for employees for example.<br/>  **Formula**: A read-only field that derives its value from a formula expression you define. The formula field is updated when any to the source fields change. <br/>  **Aggregate**: An aggregate field calculates its value from records in a related list which is linked through a header-detail relationship. You can calculate the sum, minimum, or maximum value of a field in the related list or the record count of all the records in the related list. <br/>  **AutoNumber**: A system-generated sequence number that uses a display format you define. The number is automatically incremented for each new recordand is read-only. You can set the next number to be issued with Starting Number. The maximum length of any auto-number field is 30 characters, 20 of which are reserved for prefix or suffix text. <br/>  **GuidKey**: A system-generated Globally Unique Identifier that can be used in a key field to uniquely identify a record. A guid is automatically generated for each new record and is read-only. When guids become visible, for example in your browser's address bar, they are shown as 36 characters such as this: 20641a43-ca4d-4f69-938d-13b903b0aab5<br/>  **IntegerKey**: An Integer key field uniquely identifies the records in an entity table. Integer key values are automatically incremented by SQL Server when new records are created and cannot be modified. Integer keys (also known as identity columns) are only found on standard entities. Use an AutoNumber field if you require an automatically incrementing numeric key for a custom entity.  |

On mobile displays, this option is automatically converted to the HyperlinkUnder option. <br/>  **HyperlinkUnder**: Displays the first line of the help text as a hyperlink under the field on forms and pages. When a user clicks on the link the full help text appears in a popup window. <br/>  **HyperlinkRight**: Displays the first line of the help text as a hyperlink to the right of the field on forms and pages. When a user clicks on the link the full help text appears in a popup window. <br/>  **DoNotDisplay**: Helptext does not display. This can be overriden on individual form layouts.  |

This value can be overwritten in individual lists and reports. |  
| Display Humanized Number | DisplayHumanizedNumber | Bool | Display large currency amounts in humanized form. For example, 2,345,678,901.00 will be displayed as 2.3 Bil. Currency input does not changes when this option is selected, only the display of currency amounts.  |  
| Display Humanized Date | DisplayHumanizedDate | Bool | Humanized dates improve readabllity and reduce complexity by rounding dates and times to whole units that users will be able to notice and grasp more readily. For example, a date 25 to 45 days in the past is presented as 'a month ago'.

| Min Value | MinValue | Int? |  |  
| Max Value | MaxValue | Int? |  |  
| Regex Pattern | RegexPattern | String |  |  
| Force Upper Case | ForceUpperCase | Bool | When UpperCase is checked, user input into the field is automatically capitalised.  |

| Default Value | DefaultValue | String | The value to apply when a user creates a record. Default field values are automatically inserted when a new record is created. The user can change the field’s value but the initial default field value is only executed once during new record creation.  |

| Lookup Entity Name | LookupEntityName | String<br/>  [ReadOnly] |  |  
| Lookup Field Name | LookupFieldName | String | Specifies the name of the primary key field on the lookup entity. This is almost always equal to the name of this field, for example, CustomEntity.ContactId. Leave blank to use the default name.  |  
| Lookup Entity Relationship Name | LookupEntityRelationshipName | String | Can be used to specify the relationship name (Navigation Property Name) when referring to the lookup entity. This is almost always the same the the entity name and can be left blank unless required.  |  
| Detail Entity Name | DetailEntityName | String | Specifies the name of the details (child) entity for header-detail fields.  |  
| Entity to Aggregate | EntityToAggregate | String | Specify the child entity of a header-detail relationship that contains the field to be aggregated.  |
